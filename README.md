## How does it work ?

CSSUtils is just a package. It provides you complete CSS for the simpliest tasks. For instance, Colors.css provides you classes for coloring functionalities.
To use it, you just have to put this inline in your web project :
	`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/lib/colors.min.css">`

You should always use the production minified file considering it is smaller and you should'nt add any line in the libraries.
